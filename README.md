## General info
This project is simple bikeshare project created using Python,NumPy,pandas. 
Though there are a number of ways you can go about tackling this project, we recommend using NumPy and pandas. 
Using these libraries is the industry standard for working with data in Python.

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
Python 3.7
NumPy
pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.


## Setup

## Introduction

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities
across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis 
for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though 
they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system 
to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 
These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore 
how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider 
for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
You will compare the system usage between three large cities: 
Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## Scope of functionalities
   
 Find popular day of the week based on start time, popular month of the year based on start time, popular hour of a day based on start time,
   popular trip based on the city
   
 Find total trip duration and average trip duration based on the city 
   
 Find most popular start station and most popular end station
   
 Identify youngest user,oldest user, most popular birth year to find age group 
   
 Filter data as per time period of the weekday, month
   
 Identify users( based on city, time_period and filter the city based on data fetched, 
 to find the count of all the user types.
     
 Get rawdata as per each city ahd perform data processing and return data  based on selected city name
